### Paper: Loop Parallelization in the Polytope Model<br>
### Author: Lengauer,Christian. <br> <br> Publish: International Conference on Concurrency Theory. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 1993
#### Content:
1) The paper introduced a model called polytope which can present perfect nested loops.<br>
2) By using this model, the given loop can be transformed to the targeted interpretation.<br>
3) It uses an example to show how to build a polytope model, transfrom it to a target polytope and at last transform the target polytope back to for-loop.<br>

### Paper: HIGH PERFORMANCE CODE GENERATION IN MLIR: AN EARLY CASE STUDY WITH GEMM (Need re-reading)<br>
### Author: Uday Bondhugula. <br> <br> Publish: arXiv:2003.00532 2020
#### Content:
1) This paper showcased how MLIR works by using matrix multiplication(2088*2048*2048) as its benchmark.<br>
2) The author used the tiling model proposed by "BLIS: A Framework for Rapidly Instantiating BLAS Functionality"
3) Many techniques has been included in this paper, and the author presented the result step by step, finally achieved 92% peak performance.<br>
4) Techniques: Tiling, memory packing(making data contiguous in mem),unroll, vectorization(operands vectorization),tuning tiling parameter to fit vector register.<br>
