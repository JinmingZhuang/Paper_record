### Author:Lengauer,Christian. <br> <br> Publish: International Conference on Concurrency Theory. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 1993
#### Content:
1) The paper introduced a model called polytope for parallelization of for-loops.<br>
2) It uses an example to show how to build a polytope model, transfrom it to a target polytope and at last transform the target polytope back to for-loop.<br>
